## Description
Representational similarity analysis (RSA) is a newer analytic technique that can be used for both neural and behavioral data and is great for exploring high-dimensional data or comparing data across different modalities.

## Prerequisites
1. Comfort coding in python
2. Familiarity with file path structures
3. Faimilarity with general neuroimaging analysis concepts

## Set Up (do before the workshop)
1. Make sure you've installed the following python packages:
    - [nltools](https://nltools.org/install.html) in a python 3 environment. `pip install nltools`
2. Make sure you have a python 2 and a python 3 environment.
    - Instructions on how to [set up environments with anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/switch-environment/).
    - [nltools](https://nltools.org/install.html) 
    - We will be using the nltools package to create and visual RDMs, and complete a region of interest RSA.
3. Install [pymvpa](pymvpa.org/installation.html) in a python 2 environment.
    
## Workshop objectives:
1. Introduce the basic framework of representational similarity analysis 
2. Demonstrate how to create representational dissimilarity matrices from models, behavioral data, and neuroimaging data
3. Demonstrate RSA with a region of interest approach
