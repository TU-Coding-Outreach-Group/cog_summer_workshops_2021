Data Visualization in R

Description
This workshop will cover some of the basic and intermediate functions that R visualization packages such as ggplot2, 
RColorBrewer, and sjPlot grant to users. These tools offer users substantial control over aesthetic and practical 
considerations for the presentation of their data, no matter which statistical analysis one chooses. We will start 
with a brief overview of R Markdown documents, and then move into a summary of some of the most widely applicable 
commands present in the main packages. Lastly, we will review some examples of plotting various regression and ANOVA 
analyses and some tricks I've found very useful to produce easy-to-read, aesthetically-pleasing plots.   

Prerequisites
This workshop demands that users:
1. have the R programming language downloaded, which can be accessed here:(https://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/)
2. have the R Studio user interface downloaded, which can be accessed here:(https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
3. have the packages listed in the following R script installed: (See "Visualizing Data in R.Rmd" for instructions)
4. have a basic familiarity with the R programming language

What We Won't Cover
Unfortunately, we simply won't have enough time to review the analyses relevant to each plot type. 
For example, we will demonstrate an effective means of plotting Binary Logistic Regressions in R, but we will not
spend time addressing what a Binary Logistic Regression is, or how to assess whether it might be the right 
test for your data. We will quickly review R Markdown scripting, as it is relevant to this workshop, but will not
cover it in-depth.

To-Do Before Workshop
1. Download the R Markdown script from github
2. Download the datasets for the workshop

All worshop materials are available on the COG Summer Series 2021 Github account


Supplementary
Supplementary references have been included for R Markdown, common ggplot2 plot types, and popular colors and palettes that R recognizes. 
These may be helpful to reference during the workshop, but again, are not necessary.
