    "Linux is an operating system similar to UNIX, which Macs are built off of. The linux machines at Temple are usually a \"high-end\" computer which runs off the a linux operating system, such as Ubuntu. \"High-end\" refers to the computing resources of this machine which are very powerful compared to a standard desktop.\n",

    "In summary, the linux machine is not a normal computer. It is very powerful compared to a personal computer. As such, it should serve a different purpose for labs than a typical computer, and there is a \"different way\" to use it than a personal computer. With great power, comes great responsibility."

    "## II. Why use a linux?\n",
    "Different labs might have different motivations for using a linux machine. Below, I will discuss how our lab (the Olson lab) at Temple University uses our linux machine, and the purpose it serves. \n",
    "\n",
    "The linux machine serves as a kind of server, both in terms of storing data and processing data. Users can \"ssh\" into the linux to access their data. They can complete preprocessing, analyses, anything else that can be done via the command line. However, it is recommended that the linux not be used for preprocessing, and instead, preprocessing should be done on Owlsnest. The reasoning behind this is that once you have a preprocessing pipeline locked down, it becomes mundane and does not need a lot of user intervention (you just a run few scripts, one after the other), nor does/should it change during the course of a project. Owlsnest is optimal for this because you would be able to schedule jobs to complete as others finish, without having to continually check the progress and completion of each step of your pipeline. Owlsnest also allows you to use large computing resources that are far greater than our linux, as one node from Owlsnest includes 28 cores, and Owlsnest has GPU resources. If Owslnest is used for preprocessing, this would free up our linux resources to allow users to run more \"interactive\" task with our more accessible linux machine. This would include analyses (first-level, second-level, stats, etc.) which often require a lot of development and tweaking over time. Users can use the linux machine to develop preprocessing scripts and pipelines and conducts tests. Owslnest can be tricky to beta test things, so the linux would be a good starting place as users can download relevant software and test them out. Once they get these working, they can transfer them to Owslnest for use. "

Since the linux will be used by multiple people, fail-safes need to be in place to guard against an increased likelihood of mistakes. Certain directories require sudo access to change, such as bids project directories. Installing software usually also requires sudo access. As such, if you need protected directories of files to be changed, or if you need software installed, speak to the linux administrator. Software should also be installed in a manner so that all users can use them, and this typically requires sudo access so that the software can be installed in a location all users have access to. Some softwares by default install in user specific directories (such as the user's home directory), but there are ways around this that are tricky, and so the administrator can help with this. Only users who have EXTENSIVE experience with linux-based operating systems and servers should request admin access. "

    "At the very top of this window, the 48 cores can be seen along with their usage. In this instance, only 1 CPU is being used at 4.5%. The memory bar seems like it is full, but the numbers to the right show that only 8.65GB out of 252GB (basically 256GB) are being used. In the second half of the window, the current processes that are running are being shown. Using this part is important to see which process is using what percentage of a CPU. For example, running this htop command is using 5.1% of one CPU. The USER column shows who is running that command (tuk12127, which is Haroon). This is helpful in knowing who to yell at for using too much resources (kidding). But it is helpful to know what resources are currently available and if you are able/should run whatever you are about to run. If all cores are being used, then you should wait until some free up. Generally a single command in one terminal window will use a single core. However, there are some process, especially in imaging analyses, that use multiple cores to speed things up. Be careful not to be a CPU hog, or to at least check with other users if you need to use a lot of resources. Generally, you should know the usage cost of whatever you are running on the linux. For example, when running FreeSurfer, I can configure it to run on four cores, and the command will run for 10 hours. This way I know when to expect my process to finish (in case someone needs the resources) and how to optimally use resources. Using more cores, for example, will not always give you the same benefit. See this example of how fmriprep uses resources:"

Using these text files is a way to take advantage of the cluter's batch processing, which means that the script will execute multiple commands without input from the user.

    "### Data Management\n",
    "There are a few components to consider in regards to data storage for the lab. First, data needs to be stored in a central location so that all users who need access to a dataset, can access it with ease. Second, data needs to be backed up and archived to protect against mistakes and accidents. Lastly, because of these first two points, data will probably need to be moved around frequently. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage\n",
    "The linux machine can be used for storing \"active project\" data. This means projects that are in the data collection and analysis steps. Once a project as been completed (i.e. the paper has been published and no further analyses need to be run), the data should be removed from the linux (archiving data is covered below). With 10 TBs of storage, we will not be able to keep all data from the lab on the linux indefinitely. Project data should be kept in the \"/data/projects/\" directory on the linux as a single subdirectory. Projects with purely behavioral data (i.e. no imaging) can also be stored here, but behavioral data that was collected during an imaging project should be kept in the imaging project directory (e.g. bring-back study). Active project data can also be stored on user's personal computers, but that is up to the user. Portions of a dataset maybe be on Owlsnest for preprocessing. To move data between the linux, personal computers, and owslnest, the rsync command can be used. An example of this would be if you are scanning and need to preprocess your MRI data. You would first need to download the raw scans from XNAT onto your personal computer and rsync it to the linux. Then you would unpack the data and create the niftis. Then you would transfer the niftis to Owslnest, preprocess it, and then rsync it back to the linux for analysis. In this example, data might potentially be kept in two places, the linux and Owslnest. This redundancy adds some protection in case there are issues with the data at one of these locations. However, a more systematic backup solution is optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backups and Archiving\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways in which data are systematically archived; raw dicoms are backed up onto the shared drive (Olson_Group), and project directories are backed up onto external hard drives. If possible, external hard drives will be connected to a single user's personal computer and entire project directories will be backed up via that personal computer to the external hard drive (red dashed lines in figure). If a personal computer is not available for this, hard drives can be linked connected to the linux machine to complete this back up. This is suboptimal as it can take up computing resources (although very minimal in practice), and having the backup hard drive directly connected to the linux machine can corrupt the external hard drive if the linux machine is corrected (this is a hypothetical issue and I may be paranoid). A single, exclusive, large (5TBs), external hard drive should be used for each project. Once a project is completed (no longer an \"active project\"), the external hard drive should be stored in a safe location for archiving (current the bookshelf in the back office).\n",
    "\n",
    "Backups are completed using [cronjobs](https://sites.google.com/a/temple.edu/olson-lab/-how-to-resources/linux-machine/cronjobs). Cronjobs are commands that are scheduled to run at specific times. For each project on the linux machine, two cronjobs will be set to run rsync commands for the systematic backups. Users should have Haroon set up the backups for their projects."
