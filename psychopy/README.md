## Description

This workshop will cover how to use [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/index.html) to build psychological experiments using the Builder GUI. PsycoPy is a free, open-source software for people with and without coding experience and a good alternative to E-Prime. It is popular for psychology task creation and presentation and is used in both behavioral and neuroimaging tasks, and supports online study capabilities.

## Set Up & Prerequisites
Before the workshop:

1. Install standalone [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html).

2. Download the 'stim' folder from the TU COG Github. This is the folder containing the necessary files for creating our example task.

3. Create an account on [Pavlovia](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/users/sign_in), a site that hosts online experiments. PsychoPy tasks can be pushed directly to Pavlovia for online dissemination.

## Workshop Objectives:
1. Introduce PsychoPy and the PsychoPy Builder
2. Create a basic task with visual stimuli, auditory stimuli, and looping
3. Demonstrate how PsychoPy can be integrated with Pavlovia
