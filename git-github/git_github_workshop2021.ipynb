    "# 1. Getting Started with git\n",
    "Version control in git is centered around a *repository* which holds your directories and files. For this workshop, we'll be using the command line interface or terminal to work with git. While there are other GUIs for using git, there are a number of benefits to using the command line:\n",
    "- you develop better understanding of how git commands work\n",
    "- you develop the ability to use git on any computer with bash or linux\n",
    "- learning various GUIs will be easier since you know the terminology \n",

    "## Setting up git on our local machine\n",
    "### Tell git who you are\n",
    "Git records information not only about the changes to files you make, but also *who* made those changes -- this makes it even more helpful for collaborating! For git to know who is making changes on this machine, we need to tell git about who we are.\n",
    "- *note*: be sure to use the same email address you used to create your GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"        # put quotation marks around your name\n",

    "When working with Git we will often need to provide some short but useful information. In order to enter this information, we need an editor. We’ll now tell Git which editor we want to be the default (i.e. the one that Git will bring by default whenever it wants us to provide some information).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose any editor available on your system. For this tutorial we'll be using nano (the default in mac and linux systems). There are lots of other text editors available, if you want to [check some out here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html).\n",

Some repositories ask for this in their contributing guidelines, but this can be a good approach even if it isn't required, so that you know whether the owner agrees with your suggestion. They might also bring up ideas and/or challenges you haven't considered.\n",

In either case, your PR will update automatically once you have pushed your commits."
