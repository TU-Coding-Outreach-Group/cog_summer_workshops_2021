## Description
In this workshop, we walk attendees through a series of traditional fMRI analytic steps using python so that they can get a feel for how neuromaging in python can be done. This workshop is an extremely condensed version of [Luke Chang's DartBrains Course](https://dartbrains.org/content/intro.html). DartBrains is an incredibly thorough resource which covers theory, and implementation of neuroimaging concepts and analysis. We have found this course to be very useful in completing our own analyses. 

## Prerequisites
1. Comfort coding in python
2. Familiarity with file path structures
3. Faimilarity with general neuroimaging analysis concepts

## Set Up (do before the workshop)
1. Make sure you've installed the following python packages:
    - [nltools](https://nltools.org/install.html) `pip install nltools`
    - [pyBIDS](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids) `pip install pybids`
    - [nibable](https://nipy.org/nibabel/#code) `pip install nibabel`
    - [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/introduction.html#installing-nilearn) `pip install -U --user nilearn`
    
## Workshop objectives:
1. Introduce nltools
2. Demonstrate benefits of scripting analyses in python
